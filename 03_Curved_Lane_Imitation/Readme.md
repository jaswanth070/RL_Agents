Design: Imitation Learning for a Self-Driving Car
This document outlines a project that uses Imitation Learning to train an agent to drive on a curved track. This approach is fundamentally different from Reinforcement Learning and is often used to bootstrap an agent with expert knowledge.

1. The Approach: Imitation Learning (Behavioral Cloning)
Instead of learning from trial-and-error with rewards and penalties (like Reinforcement Learning), Imitation Learning learns by directly mimicking an expert. The specific technique we'll use is called Behavioral Cloning.

The core idea is to treat the problem as a standard supervised learning task:

Input (X): The game state (what the car "sees").

Output (Y): The action the expert (a human player) took in that state.

The agent's "brain" is a neural network trained to predict the correct action for any given state, based on the examples provided by the human driver.

2. The Three-Phase Workflow
This project is structured into three distinct, sequential phases:

Phase 1: Data Collection (Human Demonstration)
The user will drive the car for 10 episodes using the arrow keys.

For every frame, the program will save the pair of (current_state, human_action).

This creates a dataset of "expert" examples.

Phase 2: Training (Behavioral Cloning)
This phase is headless (no GUI).

A neural network model is trained on the collected dataset.

The model learns to map the game states to the human's actions.

After training, the model's "brain" (its weights) is saved to a file.

Phase 3: Testing (Agent Performance)
The saved model is loaded.

The agent now takes control of the car.

It drives for several episodes on new, randomly generated tracks.

We can visually observe how well the agent has cloned the human's driving behavior and measure its performance.
